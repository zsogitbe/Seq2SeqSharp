ManagedCuda extended “GPL” license

ManagedCuda is a set of software libraries written by Michael Kunz and distributed by
Artic Imaging SARL, 540, 1ère Avenue, 06600 Antibes, France
that provides access to NVIDIA®’s CUDA® API and several of CUDA enabled utility libraries (CUFFT,
CURAND, CUSPARSE, CUBLAS, CUSOLVER, NPP, NvJitLink, NvJPEG and NVRTC) from the .net
platform. This license covers the terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification as
following.
ManagedCuda is available under GNU General Public License version 3 or a commercial license.
The GNU General Public License version 3 does not allow integrating GPLv3 source code or its compiled
binaries into a BSD licensed project.
This extended MangedCuda “GPL” license thus grants the Seq2SeqSharp project
(https://github.com/zhongkaifu/Seq2SeqSharp) the right to use ManagedCuda in form of source
code or compiled binaries under the following two conditions:
- Any derivative work of Seq2SeqSharp is allowed to use ManagedCuda under the same license
terms as Seq2SeqSharp, if ManagedCuda is only used through or for Seq2SeqSharp.
- If a derivative work of Seq2SeqSharp uses ManagedCuda independently from Seq2SeqSharp,
the standard GPLv3 license applies for ManagedCuda.
